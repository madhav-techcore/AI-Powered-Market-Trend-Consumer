AI-Powered Market Trend & Consumer Sentiment Forecaster Analysis
📌 Project Overview

The AI-Powered Market Trend & Consumer Sentiment Forecaster Analysis project aims to help businesses gain deep insights into consumer opinions, emotions, and emerging market trends by analyzing large volumes of online data.

The system collects data from multiple sources such as e-commerce platforms (Amazon and Flipkart), news APIs, and social media platforms, then processes it using data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling techniques. The final output delivers actionable insights that support marketing strategies, product optimization, and trend forecasting.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze consumer sentiment (Positive / Negative / Neutral)

Identify emerging trends and recurring patterns in customer feedback

Eliminate noisy and unstructured data for accurate analysis

Integrate multi-source data into a unified and consistent dataset

Enable data-driven business decision-making

🛠️ Project Workflow
Step 1: Data Cleaning (cleaning.py)

Removes missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant records

Standardizes textual data (lowercasing, punctuation removal, normalization)

Prepares clean and reliable data for further processing

Step 2: Data Merging

Combines datasets from Amazon and Flipkart

Ensures schema consistency across platforms

Creates a single unified dataset for analysis

Step 3: Data Reduction

Reduces dataset size after merging

Eliminates redundant and low-impact records

Improves performance and efficiency of analytical models

Step 4: Category Definition (category.py)

Defines product categories (e.g., Electronics, Fashion, Appliances)

Assigns category labels to each record

Enables category-wise sentiment and trend analysis

Step 5: Sentiment Analysis (sentiment.py)

Classifies reviews into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments

Generates timestamps for temporal sentiment trend analysis

Produces sentiment-ready data for visualization and modeling

Step 6: Topic Modeling

Applies topic modeling techniques such as LDA / BERTopic

Identifies dominant discussion themes

Extracts insights including customer complaints, praises, and feature feedback

🔌 API Integration

The project integrates multiple APIs to enrich data sources:

news_api.py – Fetches product- and brand-related news articles

reddit.py – Collects real-time user opinions and discussions from Reddit

rapid.py – Retrieves additional consumer data using RapidAPI services

These APIs enable the system to capture real-world sentiment beyond e-commerce reviews.
